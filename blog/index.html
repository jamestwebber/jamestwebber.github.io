  <p>I've finally caved in to my own egomania and decided that everyone needs to listen to me!</p>
<p>Initial thoughts on <a href="http://www.getlektor.com">Lektor</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty easy to set up something that works, and I like that it can deploy to GitHub pages automatically.</li>
<li>Not as flexible as I would hope&mdash;in fact not very flexible at all. Maybe I will discover more flexibility later.</li>
<li>It seems like I pretty much have to nuke my previous page to deploy this but that's what git is for, right? Let's see how it goes.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Redecorating</h3>
<p>The default style was kind of ugly so I decided to spruce it up with <a href="www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> which is exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<h3>A step-by-step account:</h3>
<ol>
<li>First I downloaded the CSS file and fonts from <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">their GitHub page</a> and added them to this project.</li>
<li>Then I changed the <code>layout.html</code> file to point to it.</li>
<li>That was it! Looks pretty nice without any modifications whatsoever. I may tweak it a little bit later.</li>
</ol>
