    <h2>Revolution by Jerks</h2>
  
  <p class="meta"><small></small></p>
  <section><p>One of my favorite scientific stories centered around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jay_Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a>, who was an incredible paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and science communicator. One of his biggest scientific contributions<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">together with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Eldredge">Niles Eldredge</a></span> was the concept of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium">punctuated contribution</a></em>, a model of evolution in which species and ecosystems are mostly stable until there is some cataclysmic event that dramatically changes the environment—at which point the system rapidly settles into a new steady-state<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">or equilibrium, hence the name</span>. This theory contrasted with the prevailing wisdom, which said that evolution occurred very gradually but consistently over very long time scales. Gould's theory has been somewhat-jokingly referred to as "evolution by jerks", and he infamously responded by describing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyletic_gradualism">phyletic gradualism</a> as "evolution by creeps".</p>

<h2 id="the-evolution-of-science">The Evolution of Science</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_Dobzhansky">Another evolutionary biologist</a> wrote a famous essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution." Dobzhansky essay is about how the theory of evolution is a uniting principle for everything we observe in biology—and indeed without it we would find it impossible to explain many of the phenomena we see. The title of his essay is quoted in presentations by all kinds of different biologists, as the principles of mutation and natural selection are fundamental building blocks for understanding any system in the life sciences.</p>
<p>It is perhaps surprising, then, that biologists so rarely apply this principle to the study of biology itself<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Or maybe it isn't</span>. Scientists exist in their own ecosystem, and the principles of natural selection apply to that ecosystem as surely as they do to an island of finches.</p>
