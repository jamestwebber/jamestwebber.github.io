<h1 id="concrete-strategies">Concrete Strategies</h1>
<p>Count me among those who were completely shocked by the results of the election. I trusted the polls and poll aggregators who said the result was beyond doubt going the other way, so I was totally blind-sided on the 8th. The future looks pretty scary now, for a lot of people.</p>
<p>In the long term, the situation might lead to goo things. This government is destined to fail, because its goals are incoherent and largely self-contradictory. It was voted in by people it plans to directly harm, and there will be a backlash of some kind. The aftermath could be a long-standing shift in the political alignment of the United States<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Similar to the way that disastrous conservative policies moved California voters farther to the left than any Democratic politician could have managed</span>. But that requires getting through the next four years without catastrophe, and that doesn't appear to be easy. Lots of peopple are trying to figure out what we can do to make this chapter of American history as short as possible, and mostly coming up empty. Here are a few (probably naïve) thoughts about political strategies that might be effective in a relatively short amount of time (by midterms, perhaps).</p>
<h3 id="referenda-state-legislatures">Referenda &gt; State Legislatures</h3>
<p>One daunting aspect of the road ahead is that conservatives have taken over a huge swath of the state governments as well as at the federal level. These legislatures will need to be taken back district by district, and that is a long process made more difficult by the extensive gerrymandering put into place by many of these legislatures.</p>
<p>However, many states do provide a mechanism to bypass the state legislature: a state referendum process. Like most things this process <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/States_with_initiative_or_referendum">varies from state to state</a><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">TODO: compile the requirements for listed states</span>, but in general it is possible to put a law or an amendment to the state constitution on the ballot so that the voters can decide on it. The process typically involves drafting the referendum and collecting a whole bunch of signatures. Then, the referendum will need a campaign to support it. So it's not a trivial undertaking, but it has the advantage of getting issues on the ballot that the state government may be disinclined to consider<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I don't know what ability governors and state legislature have to impede the progress of a referendum, but I assume they have some.</span>. This is important because the Republican-controlled legislatures in some of these states probably don't want to enact some of things I'm about to propose:</p>
<div class="list-container"><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Florida (amendments only)</li>
<li>Ohio</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Nevada</li>
<li>Arizona</li>
<li>Colorado</li>
</ol></div>
<p>This section isn't so much a proposed action as it's a proposed method: we can change the laws in the above states (and others) by passing legislation (or amendments) directly, without relying on legislators to do the Right Thing™. An important aspect of referenda is that they take a long time to get on the ballot, and so efforts need to start soon if they want to get onto 2018 or 2020 ballots<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">TODO: compile requirements for each state, and signature requirements</span>.</p>
<h3 id="gotvbm">GOTV(BM)</h3>
<p>GOTV (get out the vote) is a major part of most campaign strategies, particularly for Democrats who are trying to get less-consistent voters out to the polls. On the other side Republicans have made a lot of progress in voter suppression, to make it as difficult as possible to vote so that only those with spare time and resources can afford to do so. Their efforts are often illegal<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Like in North Carolina</span> but that doesn't seem to stop them<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Like in North Carolina</span>.</p>
<p>One possible strategy to work on increasing the turnout from mail-in voters. No-excuse Vote-by-mail (VBM) is available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_voting#United_States">in many states</a>, including Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Others include Nevada, Arizona, and Wisconsin, while OR, WA, and CO are <em>entirely</em> VBM</span>. The big advantage here is convenience: state governments can try to reduce the number of polling stations and/or cut early voting times, but once someone is registered to vote by mail it is hard to make it difficult for them to vote. The key here is that the deadline to register for VBM can be much earlier than the normal registration deadline<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">TODO: compile a list of requirements for the listed states</span>. Therefore, the prudent strategy is to start registration efforts <em>now</em>, long before midterms, so that voters are registered well in advance.</p>
<p>Vote-by-mail has a lot of advantages. It's cheaper than polling places, easier for voters, and it increases participation<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">TODO: find citations for this</span>. Of course, the major caveat of VBM is that it relies on an honest vote counting process. Given the naked power grabs that we've witnessed recently, there are reasons to be legitimately concerned about the vote counting in some areas.</p>
<p>Michigan doesn't have no-excuse VBM, but it <em>does</em> have a referendum process. That seems like a good place to focus efforts.</p>
<h3 id="fix-the-districts">Fix the districts</h3>
<p>Gerrymandering doesn't directly affect the Presidential election, but it does have a huge effect on Congress and state legislatures<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-9"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-9" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I don't think it's a good idea regardless of who is in charge of doing it, for whatever that's worth</span>. In a state with a referendum process, citizens could pass a law that requires an independent, nonpartisan redistricting board to determine all districts. This would take the districting process away from the people who are most inclined to abuse it (the legislators) and into the hands of a relatively impartial and balanced third party. It may even be possible to require objective measures of district fairness.</p>
<h3 id="the-popular-vote">The Popular Vote</h3>
<p>As everyone knows by now, Trump lost the popular vote by about 3 million votes—one of the biggest popular vote losses ever. The fact that he is the President-Elect is due to a ridiculous system known as the Electoral College. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact">National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</a> is something of a Hail-Mary attempt to get around that system by passing laws in individual states that collectively can select the President based on the national popular vote. Currently, the NPVIC is sitting at 165 EVs, far short of the 270 it would need to go into effect<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-10"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-10" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It's in committee in Virginia, and if it passes that'd be 178</span>. None of the six states listed above have passed it yet<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-11"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-11" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Unsurprisingly, because they tend to be swing states or conservative</span>. Those states add up to 89 Electoral Votes, which still isn't enough to get across the threshold. But if VA passes it this year and we add one more state (for instance Oregon, which is fairly liberal and has a referendum process), then we've crossed into majority-rules territory. Assuming the NPVIC survives the legal challenges that will be thrown at it.</p>
<p>The concept of the NPVIC tends to have bipartisan support among voters, so it might be able to be passed in those states if there were sufficiently large campaigns trying to pass it. On the other hand, it's no secret who will benefit from an election by popular vote, and so one would expect campaigns to prevent the referenda from passing.</p>
