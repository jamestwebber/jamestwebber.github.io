    <h2>How to Save the World, Part 2</h2>
  
  <p class="meta"><small></small></p>
  <section><p>This is an overview of the large, ill-defined and potentially-impossible biological engineering project I think could achieve carbon-sequestration on a global and historically significant scale. This is part 2—in <a href="/how-to-save-the-world-maybe">part 1</a> I tried to explain why I feel a project like this is necessary, compared to the more commonly discussed alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture</h2>
<p>The short version is this: engineer a species of oceanic cyanobacteria<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Specifically something from the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prochlorococcus">Prochlorococcus</a></em> genus</span> so that they fix carbon at a faster rate than wild-type. Recode the organism's genome so that it is entirely genetically isolated, even when released into the wild, without the need for synthetic nutrients. Let it work.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>The scale of carbon sequestration necessary to abate climate change is enormous, and no human-scale method I know of can approach the level of efficiency that would be necessary. Classical bioengineering approaches are similarly infeasible, as a managed biological solution<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">By "managed" I mean trying to sequester carbon by growing a huge amount of biomass on farms.</span> will start to encroach on and compete with agricultural resources. This is untenable because the demand for food will always overrule the need for carbon sequestration. A huge amount of carbon is captured by plankton in the ocean, and accelerating this process is an attractive strategy for sequestration. However, it raises some obvious concerns.</p>
<p>At the necessary scale it is not possible to keep this organism isolated in labs or factories—the infrastructure necessary would be far too expensive and energy-intensive. The only strategy that could plausibly achieve the right scale is if the organism grows freely in the ocean. But releasing a genetically-engineered organism to grow unchecked in the wild is a controversial idea<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">To put it mildly!</span>, and for good reason. One of the biggest challenges of this proposal is that we must weigh the plausible risks of the approach against the probable consequences of inaction. For a long time, climate change has been ignored because of the cost of action. At this point we must seriously consider the huge cost of doing nothing.</p>
<p>One major worry is the potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a>—any DNA put into bacteria will spread to any other bacteria in the same environment, almost immediately. Below I will outline a genetic-recoding method that will effectively make this impossible, and in a later post I will go into more detail.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There's always the chance that I'm overlooking a biological mechanism that would allow transfer, which is why open peer review is useful.</span> I'm confident that this aspect of the proposal is achievable; although a substantial amount of work will be involved, the building blocks have already been demonstrated by others.</p>
<p>Another concern is that such an organism might work <em>too well</em>, removing so much CO<sub>2</sub> that global temperatures fall dramatically. I typically refer to this as a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer">Snowpiercer</a></em> scenario.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Which is a bad idea from a PR standpoint but the reference is obvious.</span> This aspect of the project requires a lot more research to resolve, and I will go into the research questions I see in a later post. It's unclear whether the protein engineering necessary is possible <em>at all</em>, to say nothing of whether it could work so well that it becomes a problem.</p>
