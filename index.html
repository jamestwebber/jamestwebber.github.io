  <h2 id="hi-im-james">Hi, I'm James</h2>
<h3 id="about-me">About me</h3>
<p>I'm a graduate student in the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ucsf.edu">bioinformatics</a> program at <a href="http://www.ucsf.edu">UCSF</a>. I'm a joint student in the <a href="http://www.cancersignaling.net">Bandyopadhyay</a> and <a href="http://kroganlab.ucsf.edu">Krogan</a> labs.</p>
<p>I decided I should make a blog because tweets are too short to say some things. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<h3 id="some-projects">Some projects</h3>
<p>I've made some random projects in my copious free time.</p>
<div class="list-container"><ul>
<li><a href="http://frameshift.herokuapp.com">Frameshift</a> is currently down because of some kind of bug. When it was up, it was an A/B voting site to decide what glasses I should order from <a href="http://www.warbyparker.com">Warby Parker</a>.
<ul>
<li>I'll fix it someday. Maybe even upgrade it? And put it on GitHub?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jamestwebber/revealed3-blank">Revealed-d3</a> is a blank template for presentations that use <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/">Reveal.js</a> and <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>. It's pretty simple but I find it useful.</li>
<li>This site is (as of <a href="/blog/first-post/">today</a>) built using <a href="http://www.getlektor.com">Lektor</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. The code is hosted <a href="https://github.com/jamestwebber/jamestwebber.github.io">here</a> if you're really curious.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Actually that's not really the code at allâ€”it's the static website that gets generated by Lektor. Real code coming soon.</span></li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="some-links">Some links</h3>
<div class="list-container"><ul>
<li>I'm on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/james_t_webber">Twitter</a>, as I previously mentioned. If you think this website is way too long and/or lacking in cat gifs, you can go there.</li>
<li>I'm also on <a href="https://www.github.com/jamestwebber">GitHub</a>, although not as much as I should be.</li>
<li>I have an <a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8594-9888">ORCID</a>. I'm not totally sure what I'm doing with it but I fervently believe it's worth having.</li>
