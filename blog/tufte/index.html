  <h3>Redecorating</h3>
<p>The default style was kind of ugly so I decided to spruce it up with <a href="www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> which is exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<h3>A step-by-step account:</h3>
<ol>
<li>First I downloaded the CSS file and fonts from <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">their GitHub page</a> and added them to this project.</li>
<li>Then I changed the <code>layout.html</code> file to point to it.</li>
<li>That was it! Looks pretty nice without any modifications whatsoever. I may tweak it a little bit later.</li>
</ol>
