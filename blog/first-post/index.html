  <p>I've finally caved in to my own egomania and decided that everyone needs to listen to me!</p>
<p>Initial thoughts on <a href="http://www.getlektor.com">Lektor</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pretty easy to set up something that works, and I like that it can deploy to GitHub pages automatically.</li>
<li>Not as flexible as I would hope&mdash;in fact not very flexible at all. Maybe I will discover more flexibility later.</li>
<li>It seems like I pretty much have to nuke my previous page to deploy this but that's what git is for, right? Let's see how it goes.</li>
</ul>
