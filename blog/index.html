  <p>I like how this looks but I wanted more functionality—particularly the sidenotes from Tufte CSS.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-0"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Look! A sidenote! <br><br>And yes, this is still a blog about making a blog. I'll get to other topics eventually.</br></br></span></p>
<p>Looking around for options, I stumbled on <a href="http://coppeliamla.github.io/glasseye/glasseye_markdownExample/demo.html">Glasseye</a>, by <a href="http://www.coppelia.io/author/simonraper/">Simon Raper</a>, which looks really nice. He's combining Markdown, Tufte CSS, and <a href="https://www.d3js.org">d3.js</a> in one package! Those are three things I like! And it's in Python!</p>
<p>After digging into it, I ended up with a fairly stripped-down version of his code, to the extent that I just stuck it straight into a Lektor plugin rather than using the Glasseye package itself<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">That reminds me, I really need to put the <em>actual code</em> for this site up on Github…</span>. For now I have jettisoned all of his (very nice) d3 charts, because I'm instinctively against the idea of letting <em>the Man</em> design my plots for me. I can make my own d3 charts, thank you very much.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">But they do look pretty snazzy.</span> I just noticed that the sidenotes don't turn into pop-ups when the screen gets small, which is how they're supposed to work. I should fix that.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Update: I did!</span></p>
<p>On Monday I visited with <a href="https://twitter.com/lteytelman">Lenny Teytelman</a><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="sn-4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="sn-4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I interact with him mostly through Twitter so I might as well link to that.</span> of <a href="https://www.protocols.io">Protocols.io</a>, and we talked about a variety of stuff including the intersection of open-access science publishing and startups. One of the reasons I made this blog was so I could stick those ideas somewhere…maybe that'll be the next post.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'll change the font sizes and write about that. <label class="margin-toggle" for="mn-0">⊕</label><input class="margin-toggle" id="mn-0" type="checkbox"/><span class="marginnote">And I know I'm going crazy with the sidenotes, they're fun.</span></p>

  <h3 id="redecorating">Redecorating</h3>
<p>The default style was kind of ugly so I decided to spruce it up with <a href="www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> which is exactly what it sounds like.</p>
<h3 id="a-step-by-step-account">A step-by-step account:</h3>
<div class="list-container"><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First I downloaded the CSS file and fonts from <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">their GitHub page</a> and added them to this project.</li>
<li>Then I changed the <code>layout.html</code> file to point to it.</li>
<li>That was it! Looks pretty nice without any modifications whatsoever. I may tweak it a little bit later.</li>
</ol></div>
<p>I just retroactively <em>lied</em> and changed the date on this post, solely so that it would show up in the right order on the blog page. Sue me.</p>
<p>I'm not super happy with how it looks right now anyway—I may decide to get rid of the entire page. Or I just need to write longer blog posts. Luckily no one will ever read this.</p>

  <p>I've finally caved in to my own egomania and decided that everyone needs to listen to me!</p>
<p>Initial thoughts on <a href="http://www.getlektor.com">Lektor</a>:</p>
<div class="list-container"><ul>
<li>Pretty easy to set up something that works, and I like that it can deploy to GitHub pages automatically.</li>
<li>Not as flexible as I would hope—in fact not very flexible at all. Maybe I will discover more flexibility later.</li>
<li>It seems like I pretty much have to nuke my previous page to deploy this but that's what git is for, right? Let's see how it goes.</li>
</ul></div>
